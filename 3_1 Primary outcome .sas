/*Sustained PrEP outcome:*/
/*1.	Your definition below of 8wks post-initiation through 6 months, and we are also adding 12 months post. */
/*LG:  Dan’s feedback on Oct 5th was to use “ANY DBS in the period.” Given this, to assess availability of primary outcome data for this PrEP primary, I believe that all randomized pts are included in the denominator and the denominator value for each pt is the # of expected DBS (0, 1, 2 or 3). The numerator is number of collected/recorded DBS (0, 1, 2 or “3 or more”) and is based on the number of DBS collected during the following period:  8wks post-rand through 6mo post-rand.*/
/*•	If a pt is not prescribed PrEP w/in 6mo post-rand, then his “score” would be 0/0. */
/*•	If a pt is prescribed PrEP w/in 6mo post-rand, then his denominator would be set as 1, 2 or 3 according to when in that 6mo window he initiated PrEP.*/
/*To describe availability of this outcome (as part of our “retention” reports), and based on the above, I am considering all pts with a score of 0/0 or who have a numerator value < denominator value (e.g., 0/1, 0/2, 0/3, 1/2, 1/3 or 2/3) as a 0 -- outcome data NOT available and all pts with a numerator value =/> denominator (e.g., 1/1, 2/2, 3/3, 4/3, 5/3) as a 1 – outcome data available.*/

/*What I do not know is the cutoff that Dan wants to use for “6mo post-rand.” This could be measured at the 6-mo visit “target date” (183 days post-rand) or at the close of the 6-mo window (245 days post-rand).  */
